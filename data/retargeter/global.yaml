# Global parameters for the retargeter
title: global

# CPU or CUDA
# Default: CUDA
# Effect: CUDA only available in certain environments
device: cpu

# Adam and RMSProp
# Default: RMSProp
# Effect: Different types of optimization methods for ML
# You can select another from here https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#algorithms but you will need to change the code in retargeter.py
optimizer: RMSprop

# Default: 2.5
# Effect: How fast the gradient descent runs down-hill. Too low and it will take forever to converge, too high and it will overshoot
lr: 2.5

# Default 3
# Effect: How many times the retargeter will try to optimize the hand model
# The higher the number, the more accurate the hand model will be but also the more computation
opt_steps: 2

# Default: 0.71
# Effect: The weight scaling for coupled joints
coupled_scale: 0.71
